# just-the-docs-template

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a [Jekyll] site that:

- uses the [Just the Docs] theme;
- can be built and published on [GitHub Pages];
- can be built and previewed locally, and published on other platforms.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem;
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo).

After completing the creation of your new site on GitHub, update it as needed:

## Replace the content of the template pages

Update the following files to your own content:

- `index.md` (your new home page)
- `README.md` (information for those who access your site repo on GitHub)

## Changing the version of the theme and/or Jekyll

Simply edit the relevant line(s) in the `Gemfile`.

## Adding a plugin

The Just the Docs theme automatically includes the [`jekyll-seo-tag`] plugin.

To add an extra plugin, you need to add it in the `Gemfile` *and* in `_config.yml`. For example, to add [`jekyll-default-layout`]:

- Add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

  ```ruby
  gem "jekyll-default-layout"
  ```

- And add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
  plugins:
    - jekyll-default-layout
  ```

Note: If you are using a Jekyll version less than 3.5.0, use the `gems` key instead of `plugins`.

## Publishing your site on GitHub Pages

1.  If your created site is `YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-SITE-NAME`, update `_config.yml` to:

    ```yaml
    title: YOUR TITLE
    description: YOUR DESCRIPTION
    theme: just-the-docs

    url: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-SITE-NAME

    aux_links: # remove if you don't want this link to appear on your pages
      Template Repository: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-SITE-NAME
    ```

2.  Push your updated `_config.yml` to your site on GitHub.

3.  In your newly created repo on GitHub:
    - go to the `Settings` tab -> `Pages` -> `Build and deployment`, then select `Source`: `GitHub Actions`.
    - if there were any failed Actions, go to the `Actions` tab and click on `Re-run jobs`.

## Building and previewing your site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

## Publishing your built site on a different platform

Just upload all the files in the directory `_site`.

## Customization

You're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like!

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

## Hosting your docs from an existing project repo

You might want to maintain your docs in an existing project repo. Instead of creating a new repo using the [just-the-docs template](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template), you can copy the template files into your existing repo and configure the template's Github Actions workflow to build from a `docs` directory. You can clone the template to your local machine or download the `.zip` file to access the files.

### Copy the template files

1.  Create a `.github/workflows` directory at your project root if your repo doesn't already have one. Copy the `pages.yml` file into this directory. GitHub Actions searches this directory for workflow files.

2.  Create a `docs` directory at your project root and copy all remaining template files into this directory.

### Modify the GitHub Actions workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys your site to Github Pages is defined by the `pages.yml` file. You'll need to edit this file to that so that your build and deploy steps look to your `docs` directory, rather than the project root.

1.  Set the default `working-directory` param for the build job.

    ```yaml
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      defaults:
        run:
          working-directory: docs
    ```

2.  Set the `working-directory` param for the Setup Ruby step.

    ```yaml
    - name: Setup Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.1'
          bundler-cache: true
          cache-version: 0
          working-directory: '${{ github.workspace }}/docs'
    ```

3.  Set the path param for the Upload artifact step:

    ```yaml
    - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
        with:
          path: "docs/_site/"
    ```

4.  Modify the trigger so that only changes within the `docs` directory start the workflow. Otherwise, every change to your project (even those that don't affect the docs) would trigger a new site build and deploy.

    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - "main"
        paths:
          - "docs/**"
    ```

## Installation

### Use the template

The [Just the Docs Template] provides the simplest, quickest, and easiest way to create a new website that uses the Just the Docs theme. To get started with creating a site, just click "[use the template]"!

Note: To use the theme, you do ***not*** need to clone or fork the [Just the Docs repo]! You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the Docs.

You can easily set the site created by the template to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [template README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^2] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with the template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

### Use RubyGems

Alternatively, you can install the theme as a Ruby Gem, without creating a new site.

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "just-the-docs"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: just-the-docs
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install just-the-docs

Alternatively, you can run it inside Docker while developing your site

    $ docker-compose up

### Design and development principles of this theme:

1. As few dependencies as possible
2. No build script needed
3. First class mobile experience
4. Make the content shine

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme: fork this repo, the run `bundle install` from the root directory.

A modern [devcontainer configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for VSCode is included.

Your theme is set up just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When this theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` tracked with Git will be included in the gem.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
