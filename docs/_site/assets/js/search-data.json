However, you can find similar courses on Udemy. | Jekyll: make fast, secure static sites and blogs with Jekyll . A consistent and logical course. General enough to understand the big picture and detailed enough to bring your project to life. For additional information, you can refer to the documentation or YouTube . | Ultimate Docker Fast-Track Beginner to Advanced . A decent course on Docker basics. The rest is complemented by practice. One of the key courses that helped create a site on GitHub Pages. I don’t know Ruby, Liquid etc, and I don’t want to install all that zoo on my laptop. And then maintain all the versions and plugins. All this can be done in a Docker container. | Java 7 &amp; Java 8 new features with Lambdas &amp; Streams . An interesting course on the capabilities of “Java 7” / “Java 8”. The lecturer’s pronunciation allows you to watch the videos at a speed of x1.75. The lectures are accompanied by practical examples . | Practical Java Unit Testing with JUnit 5 . The course provides an overall picture. The lecturer’s pronunciation allows videos to be watched at x2.0 speed . | GitHub Actions - The Complete Guide . A course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. I won’t say that the course was easy for me. It’s better to brush up on Linux basics and know how specific frameworks and systems work. The rest is just practice . | Markdown Mastery: Simple yet Powerful Writing Format . Markdown is easy to use and learn. The course quickly helps you understand the basics. Practice will fill in the rest . | . ",

The colors grey-lt, grey-dk, purple, blue, green, yellow, and red are predefined; to use a custom color, you need to define its 000 and 300 levels in your SCSS files.
