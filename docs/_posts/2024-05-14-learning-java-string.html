There are two ways to check if two Strings are equal. You can use the == operator or the equals() method. When you use the == operator, it checks for the value of String as well as the object reference. Often in Java programming you want to check only for the equality of the String value. In this case, you should use the equals() method to check if two Strings are equal. There is another function called equalsIgnoreCase that you can use to ignore case.
