This course covers the changes introduced in Java (versions 7 and 8).  
It's perfect for gaining a comprehensive understanding of these changes. The course is accompanied by code examples / explanations and helps learners understand the evolution of Java and its key improvements.

**Main Topics:**
- New features and enhancements
- Default and static methods in interfaces
- Lambda expressions
- Functional interfaces
- Method & constructor references
- Streams API

Despite its 10-hour duration, the course only covers the basics. Plus, there's time allocated for code demonstrations. Therefore, the duration is not excessive for the content.

The lecturer's diction allows for listening to the videos at 1.75x speed.
